# Algorithms R Us
___
### Project overview
I have been tasked to create a program which offers the user a choice between different sorting algorithms.
Once a sort method has been chosen the program then prompts the user to input the size of an array to 
undergo sorting. The program generates, sorts and records the time taken for the operation to be completed,
on the random array of user defined length.
___
#### Sort methods featured
* Bubble Sort
* Merge Sort
* Binary Tree Search
* Insertion Sort

The program also features the JDK sort method - this method can be used to measure the efficiency of the 
custom written sort methods.
___
### Compare against feature
I have included a 'compare against' feature in which the user can choose two methods at one time, input an array length,
and compare the speeds in which each respective method completes execution of the sorting instructions.

As an extension to the former mentioned feature, there is also a compare all option, in which the user can measure
efficiency of all the sorting methods in one go.
___
### Logging
Some error logs, but primarily logs compare runs. So the user can run multiple compares and retain past results.
